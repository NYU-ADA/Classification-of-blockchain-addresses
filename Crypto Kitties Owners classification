Who got a Crypto Kitty?

# Case for NYU workshop on Blockchain Address Classification

Problem Formulation

We will  classify addresses, which own crypto kitties, as a class of "Crypto Kitties Owners".

So basically our task is to separate all blockchain addresses to 2 classes - 'owners' and 'not owners'
of kitties, based just on the history of their transactions, ***without knowing*** the actual fact of crypto kitty ownership.

This can be considered as behavioral analysis, and used for predictions, recommendations and other purposes.
